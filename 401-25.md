#  Redux - Combined Reducers


- Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

If you have a larger application with a lot of state updates.

- What is the purpose of a reducer?

It determines changes to our application's state, using the action it receives to decide which change to make. ([source](https://css-tricks.com/understanding-how-reducers-are-used-in-redux/))

- What does an action contain?

Two keys and their values. For example:

```js
const action = {
  type: 'NEW_CONTACT',
  name: 'Tim Egorov',
}
```

- Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

> If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part. ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39521868/why-does-redux-need-to-make-a-copy-of-the-data-each-time-it-changes))


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- immutable state

> Immutability can bring increased performance to your app, and leads to simpler programming and debugging, as data that never changes is easier to reason about than data that is free to be changed arbitrarily throughout your app. ([source](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data))

- time travel in redux

> The Redux DevTools records dispatched actions and the state of the Redux store at every point in time. This makes it possible to inspect the state and travel back in time to a previous application state without reloading the pace or restarting the app. ([source](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/time-travel-in-react-redux-apps-using-the-redux-devtools-5e94eba5e7c0))

- action creator

> An action creator is merely a function that returns an action object. ([source](https://read.reduxbook.com/markdown/part1/04-action-creators.html))

- reducer

Reducers are functions that take the current `state` and an `action` as arguments, and return a new `state` result. In other words, `(state, action) => newState.`

([source](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers))

- dispatch

> dispatch is a function of the Redux store. You call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. ([source](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch))
