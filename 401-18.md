# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook



- Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

Single page apps only use a single .html page and render/hide content depending on the route.

- If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />


 - What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

It hides those components.

- What does props.children contain?

> ...can have one element, multiple elements, or none at all, its value is respectively a single child node, an array of child nodes or undefined ([source](https://learn.co/lessons/react-this-props-children))

- How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

> setState is merging the previous state with the new one, it means that you dont have to pass the full state object every time you want to change some part of the state. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/b46fv0/the_difference_between_setstate_and_usestate/))

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- State Hook

One of the most used hooks. Allows functional components to have states. Allows manipulation of DOM components.

- Mounting and Un-Mounting

> "Mounting" is when React "renders" the component for the first time and actually builds the initial DOM from those instructions. ([source](https://reacttraining.com/blog/mount-vs-render/))

> Unmounting. The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it. ([source](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp))
