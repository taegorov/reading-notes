# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 13

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

>In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = *Informational codes*. Request was received, and the server is trying. It can mean "so far, everything is okay." 

- 200’s = *Success codes*. Requests is successful. Sometimes, like with 202, the request has been received but nothing has been done with it yet.

- 300’s = *Redirection codes*. The request isn't at that location anymore (it may have moved).

- 400’s = *Client error codes*. Could be an incorrect URI, a timeout, missing or incorrect authentication, URL not recognized, etc.

- 500’s = *Server error codes*. Servers are overwhelmed or unreachable. Can be temporary or permanent.

> What is a status code 202?

202 means "accepted." The request was received and valid, but the processing is not yet complete.

> What is a status code 308?

308 means "permanent redirect." The client should use a different URL to access the content because it isn't at that location anymore.

> What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

204.

> What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

410.

> What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

403.

> Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

 When we deploy our app, we'll want to use something that **isn't** localhost. The .env will hold our URL info, and we can refer to that .env instead of hard coding.

> What is middleware?

Code that runs when the server gets a request but before it gets passed to your routes.

> What does app.use(express.json()) do?

Lets our server accept JSON as a body instead of a post, get, etc. element.

> What does the /:id mean in a route?

It is a parameter we can access by typing in `req.params.id`. Gives access to whatever the user passes in after the first `/`

> What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?

If a user is updating and only fills out part of the total information (so maybe just a name), we only update the DB based on what the user passes us. It does not updating the other information fields. Put updates all the info about the subscriber (or user, favorite books, etc.) at once, instead of just the information that is selectively updated.

> How do you make a default value in a schema?

Add a property named `default:`. The video used `default: Date.now`.

> What does a 500 error status code mean?

There's an error on your server. The actual server had some kind of error that caused the transaction not to work, and the client/user is not at fault.

> What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

A 200 means everything was successful. A 201 message means we successfully created something (in the video, that something is an object).
