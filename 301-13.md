# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 13

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

>In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = *Informational codes*. Request was received, and the server is trying. It can mean "so far, everything is okay." 

- 200’s = *Success codes*. Requests is successful. Sometimes, like with 202, the request has been received but nothing has been done with it yet.

- 300’s = *Redirection codes*. The request isn't at that location anymore (it may have moved).

- 400’s = *Client error codes*. Could be an incorrect URI, a timeout, missing or incorrect authentication, URL not recognized, etc.

- 500’s = *Server error codes*. Servers are overwhelmed or unreachable. Can be temporary or permanent.
