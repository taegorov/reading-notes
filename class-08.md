# Reading Notes Code 201: Day 8

### Notes - HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

Re-read chapter. Notes found [here](read04.md).

#### New Notes:

Place elements next to each other (side by side) by using **Float** 

`Clear` a float, tells it that no other element can touch its left or right sides

Mobile-friendliness is important! Adjusting font-size or image size by Pixel might not be the right call. Some computers have really high resolutions (4K is pretty common now!) and those fonts/images will end up tiny.

If you are using pixel size, make your pages ~960-1000px wide

##### Fixed Width vs Liquid Layout

Fixed is static and does not adjust if a user is increasing/decreasing the size of their window. Used pixels.

Liquid *does* change if a user adjusts the size of their browser window. Uses percentages.

##### Layout Grids

Useful for orienting items on your page. **Not as restrictive as it sounds.** This seems the easiest to wireframe since you can just pick how big you want your individual elements to be!
