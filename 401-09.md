# Socket.io


- What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?

> used to optimize the use of the channel capacity available in digital telecommunication networks, such as computer networks, and minimize the transmission latency (the time it takes for data to pass across the network), and to increase robustness of communication. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching))

- UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?

> UDP is a connectionless protocol. No connection needs to be established between the source and destination before you transmit data. UDP does not have a mechanism to make sure that the payload is not corrupted. As a result, the application must take care of data integrity all by itself. ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/connectionless-protocol))

- Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?

Yes

- Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?

Yes

- Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?

Yes


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Observer Pattern

![observer-pattern](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Observer_w_update.svg/500px-Observer_w_update.svg.png)
> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern))

- Listener

An element that waits for a specific event to take place in order to run some code or function.

- Event Handler

> [event handler code] will run when an event fires, allowing web pages to respond appropriately to change. ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers))

- Event Driven Programming

>  ...event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming))

- Event Loop

> ...the event loop is a programming construct or design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program. The event loop works by making a request to some internal or external "event provider" (that generally blocks the request until an event has arrived), then calls the relevant event handler ("dispatches the event"). ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop))

- Event Queue

> The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution. ([source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript))

- Call Stack


> The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. ([source](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-an-event-loop-in-javascript))


- Emit/Raise/Trigger

Emit: "Much of the Node.js core API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called." ([source](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html))

Trigger:  "Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type." ([source](https://api.jquery.com/trigger/))

- Subscribe

One half of the pub/sub equation. 

> Publish/Subscribe is a common pattern within JavaScript applications. The idea is that you have a publisher that emits events and you have consumers which register their interest in a given event. ([source](https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/content/how_do_i/simple_event_emitter.html))

- database

> ...an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database))
