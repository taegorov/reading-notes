- What are serverless functions?

> single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies. ([source](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/what-is-a-serverless-function/))

- If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

The same way we were doing when we were working with Express, but each function would be its own file.

In order to improve speed and connectivity, a CDN will place servers at the exchange points between different networks. ([source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/))
