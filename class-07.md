Determine the metrics whose variables you can easily change. In the reading's example, the *popularity* of a sample video can be determined by a 1-10 rating, and a true/false value. To determine *popularity*, you just have need to factor in 2 measurable variables.
 - The *popularity* in this case is the constructor

New term: **instantiated**.

`new` instantiates an object.

`this` variable initializes properties of an object -- (is this still necessary?)
