# Context API


- Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()

> ...used to memoize (like we do in Dynamic Programming, concept wise) and skip recalculation. It is useful when you don't want to recalculate heavy calculations each time a component renders. ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66429202/what-are-production-use-cases-for-the-useref-usememo-usecallback-hooks))

useReducer is good for when you have multiple values and variables that you'll want to change.

- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

> This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of Rules of Hooks because we couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it. ([source](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook))

- What do custom hooks usually do?

> Custom hooks allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks. [(source)]

- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

[useClippy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-clippy) seems pretty sweet. It might be useful to add to a button that automatically copies the context of a textbox on your site, so the user doesn't have to select everything and hit CTRL C.

[useLocalStorage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rehooks/local-storage) is cool too.

- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

This seems like a pretty big topic, [THIS LINK](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data) provides a great step-by-step process.

[This link](https://dev.to/madara/fetching-data-with-react-hooks-and-fetch-api-beginners-guide-2ick) also walks through the process.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- reducer

> The first and most important thing to understand about a reducer is that it will always only return one value. The job of a reducer is to reduce. That one value can be a number, a string, an array or an object, but it will always only be one. Reducers are really great for a lot of things, but they’re especially useful for applying a bit of logic to a group of values and ending up with another single result.
