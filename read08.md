# Comparison and Logical Operators

`==` IS EQUAL TO

`!=` IS NOT EQUAL TO

`===` STRICT EQUAL TO

`!==` STRICT NOT EQUAL TO

`>` GREATER THAN

`<` LESS THAN

`>=` GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO

`<=` LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO

### Logical Operators

The below are Logical Operators:

`&&` is a **Logical And**

- Asks if 2 expressions both result in `true` 
> Tests more than one condition

`||` is a **Logical Or**
- Asks if *either* expressions result in `true`
> Tests at least one condition

`!` is a **Logical Not**
- If an expression is `true`, it changes it to `false`
> Reverses the state of an expression

## Loops

A code block will run repeatedly (in a loop) until it returns the condition of `false`. 

`for` runs a code a certain number of times

`while` code will continue to run as long as a condition is `true`

`do...while` like `while`, with some caveats

## Loop Counters

- Initialization
  - Create a variable and sets it to a certain number (for example, 0)

- Condition
  - Loop will continue until the counter reaches a certain number (for example <10)

- Update
  - Every time the code within curly braces is run, it changes the counter value (for example `i++` or `i--` adds or subtracts one, respectively)
