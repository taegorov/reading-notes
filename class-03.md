# Reading Notes Code 201: Day 3

### Notes - Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

- Two types of lists: ordered and unordered
  
- Use `<ol>` for Ordered Lists -- these will appear like so:
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
4. and so on

- Use `<ul>` for Unordered Lists -- these will appear like so:
- item 1
- item 2
  - nested item 2.1
  - nested item 2.2

- IMPORTANT NOTE: before the lists will actually look like that, you have to add `<li>` or list items (in the examples above, the list items would be "item 1" etc.)

- Another important note: to create the nested look, you have to put another `<ol>` or `<ul>` element inside an `<li>` element

- Use `<dl>` for Definition Lists
  - `<dt>` for what is being defined
  - `<dd>` for the definition itself


### Notes - Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

### Notes - Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
