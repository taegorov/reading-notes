- Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

> Ducks is essentially a proposal for bundling reducers, action types, and actions all into the same file

> Ducks seeks to solve the issue of the toggled back and forth repetitive nature of organizing by type. With Ducks, rather than splitting up all the related code, I can package it into redux modules.

- What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

> Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- redux toolkit slices

> A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators ([source](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createslice))

- namespace

Variables like `ADD_NEW_NAME` and `REPLACE_USER` in redux.
