# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 12

> SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb ([source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool))

- SQL databases are 'table-based' (represents data in the form of a table) whereas NoSQL are 'document-based' (represents data in form of key-value pairs, etc)

- NoSQL is good for unstructured data

- SQL = Vertically scalable - improves with more processing power (CPU, RAM, SSD) 

- NoSQL = Horizontally scalable - improves with with more servers

- SQL = Structured Query Language

> In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database ([source](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool))

- NoSQL is good for hierarchical data since it stores data similar to JSON. It's the best option for big data sets

SQL offerings include:

1. MySQL
2. MS-SQL
3. Oracle Express

NoSQL offerings include:

1. MongoDB
2. CouchDB
3. Redis

- SQL was designed with the end user in mind

- ["Key-Value storage is a very simplistic, but very powerful model."](https://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/nosql-data-modeling-techniques/)

- NoSQL asks "what questions do I have?" vs. Relational modeling which asks "what answers do I have?"
