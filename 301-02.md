# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 2

Note: I accidentally read all of the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) page for Read 01. My notes for that particular reading can be found in the day 1 reading [here]([301-01.md).

- `state` is like `props` but remains inside of a component. They are **local** (AKA top-down/unidirectional)

- In React, "mounting" is when an element is initially inserted into the DOM. The reading uses an example of a timer that is set up whenever the Constructor `Clock` is rendered. "Unmounting" is when that timer is removed.

- use `this.setState` syntax instead of `this.state`

- `setState` works just as well with functions as it does with arrow functions

- Events are similar with React, but the syntax differs

- Same functionality in HTML vs React:

```
<button onclick="setName()">
```

```
<button onClick={setName}>
```

- [Link to SyntheticEvents here](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)

- In React, you don't need to use `addEventListener` to DOM elements, just when it's first rendered
  
- The reading shows a really slick way of displaying whether a user is signed into their website or not (displaying corresponding 'welcome' messages). It uses a prop named `isLoggedIn` that can either be true or false. These can be easily tied to buttons that log a user in and out

- The reading also utilizes a *falsy* expression to achieve a particular goal (in this case, a certain number of unread messages)
