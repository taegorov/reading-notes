# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 6

## Node.js

> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Googleâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
>
> ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info)) 

- V8 engine is an open source JS engine that runs in Chrome (not FireFox ðŸ˜ž)

> Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime. ([source](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/))

- At the time of this writing, I have Node v12.20.2 installed

- Uses "modern JavaScript features" like template literals, object destructuring, and Array.prototype.flatMap():

- Node comes with a "package manager" called npm, which we've used to start React (`npm start` and `npm install`). It is also used to install packages locally. My version of npm at time of writing is 7.9.0

- Node.js is "event driven" -- it's able to tackle a large number of connections simultaneously. It is uniquely suited for apps that require interaction/collaboration (the reading lists chat sites and apps like [CodeShare](https://codeshare.io/) as examples)

- Node.js "speaks JSON", which is "...probably the most important data exchange format on the web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases" ([source](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/))

## Pair Programming

- 2 devs working on the same computer, working on code together

- Much encouraged by Code Fellows!

- The driver is the one actually entering the info, while the navigator does the talking
  - Navigator doesn't actually enter any code, they're more "big picture" oriented

- Great way to talk out, almost wireframe, what your code should be doing

- Takes a bit more time, but produces higher quality code

- More engaging for both parties, less likely to be distracted

- Introduces you to other techniques you might not have considered

- Improves communication! Employers love this

- Preps you for job interviews, and you'll be turn-key at your new job
