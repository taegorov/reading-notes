# Express REST API


> Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

1. If you want block a page of your website unless someone is logged in 
2. Cyber security 
3. Error handling


> True or false: The route handler is middleware?

False

> In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

End the process with `next()`, send data with `response.status(error code here).send`


> At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

The middleware is injected right after the first request to the server, assuming that request uses `next()` along with `request` and `response`. 

> What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

When duplicate responses are sent to the user or the server. 


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Middleware

> Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next. ([source](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html))

- Request Object

>  the req object is one half of the request and response cycle to examine calls from the client side, make HTTP requests, and handle incoming data whether in a string or JSON object. ([source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-req-object-in-expressjs))

- Response Object

> the res object is one half of the request and response cycle to send data from the server to the client-side through HTTP requests. ([source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-res-object-in-expressjs))

- Application Middleware

`app.use()`, `app.get()`, and the like. Sends requests to the server.

> The function is executed every time the app receives a request. ([source](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.application))

- Routing Middleware

> Router-level middleware works in the same way as application-level middleware, except it is bound to an instance of express.Router(). ([source](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.router))

`next()` -- ensures that 

- Test Driven Development

> “Test-driven development” refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests) and design (in the form of refactoring).([source](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1)))

- Behavioral Testing

> [Behavioral testing] means writing automated tests in a language that is meaningful to the business people. So where technical language is OK in TDD, you would want to avoid it in BDD. ([source](https://www.testim.io/blog/cucumber-js-for-bdd-an-introductory-tutorial-with-examples/))
