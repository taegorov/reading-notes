# Reading Notes Day 2

## Version Control

Version Control System (VCS)

Version Type | Notes
------------ | -------------
Local Version Control (Local VCS) | The content lives on your hard drive
Centralized Version Control (CVCS) | Came about due to a need for collaboration <br> Files stores on a server <br> Can be accessed by multiple users <br> **Collaborative**
Distributed Version Control (DVCS) | Like a CVS, but files (repositories) are stored in multiple places <br> **Git is a DVCS**

## What is Git?

Git saves "snapshots" of your project each time you "commit." "Commit" is sort of like "save current version," where previous versions of the file are saved as well. 

You can work on projects even when not connected to the internet, then upload later.

Git protects against file corruption and irreversible file damage.

State | Notes

Committed | Data is saved on your hard drive (or local database)
Modified | Data is changed but not "saved" (committed)
Staged | File ready to be committed
