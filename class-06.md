# Reading Notes Code 201: Day 3

### Notes - Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

I really liked this part:

```
Normally when you put together a jigsaw puzzle you follow steps that might look something like this:

- Figure out what the major components of the picture are
- Sort the pieces by color or component
- Put together all the border pieces
- Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created

**This all breaks down when you don’t have a picture with clear components that you can identify.**

```

We can apply this mentality to code, where we write smaller pieces with full awareness of the bigger picture. However, the real world is not always like that. **It is much easier when we have that full awareness.**

If we have the complete specifications of the finished product, along with what our code should do when X occurs, our job is easy.

Understanding the problem makes our jobs easier!

Measure twice, cut once. Understand the actual problem before attempting to code.


### Notes - Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of something you would recognize from the real world
> - Jon Duckett, JavaScript & JQuery, page 100

If a variable is in an object, it becomes a property

If a function is in an object, it becomes a method

"Literal notation" is the main way to make an object
- Example would be `name: 'Tim',`

"Dot notation"  
- Example would be `let userName = user.name;`

### Notes - Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
