A *growth mindset* is a mentality in which someone believes they can constantly improve through effort and perseverance. This is at odds with a *fixed mindset*, which suggests that your intelligence and talent are unchanging. 

If you love learning and overcoming obstacles, you might already have a *growth mindset*. 

[Here is a handy image illustrating the differences between these mindsets.](https://3kllhk1ibq34qk6sp3bhtox1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/NewGrowthMindset2.png)


## How to keep myself in a growth mindset:
- I can stay positive, even during difficult times

- I can use difficult times as an opportunity to learn

- I can take inspiration from the successes of others and reach out when necessary

>A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover Iâ€™m able to achieve more and set higher goals.
