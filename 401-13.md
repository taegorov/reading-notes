# AWS: S3 and Lambda


- Describe “The Cloud”

> "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines. ([source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/))

- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. ([source](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container))

- What is auto-scaling?

> ...a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling))

- What is bandwidth?

> ...the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)))

- How do cloud providers compute service costs?

How much traffic they get, how powerful the virtual machines are, and how many things (like elastic beanstalk) you might have running.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Server Instances

> A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately. ([source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance))

- Containers

> A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. ([source](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container))

- Cloud Services

> The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. From checking email to collaborating on documents, most employees use cloud services throughout the workday, whether they’re aware of it or not. ([source](https://www.citrix.com/solutions/digital-workspace/what-is-a-cloud-service.html))

- Cloud Architecture

> Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. ([source](https://www.hcltech.com/technology-qa/what-is-cloud-architecture))

- AWS

> Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services))

- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku

Comparable features and pricing. Heroku gets crazy expensive the more features you add (auto-scaling), and AWS is linear. AWS has an extremely steep learning curve, though, which is essentially why Heroku exists in the first place.
