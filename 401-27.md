#  Redux - Additional Topics


- What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

You could have a component that wraps around your app, such as a provider.

- When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

The object from the reducer.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- middleware

> Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more. ([source](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store))

- thunk

> Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to call the action creators that return a function(thunk) which takes the store's dispatch method as the argument and which is afterwards used to dispatch the synchronous action after the API or side effects has been finished.
