# AWS: Cloud Servers

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

> First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user. ([source](https://backend.turing.edu/module2/lessons/how_the_web_works_http))

- Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

The requester is the client and the responder is the server.

- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  
A deployed application is hosted on a server (Heroku, Netlify, AWS) and accessible by other machines, non-locally.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Server

> Computer processes that provide application services are referred to as servers, and create sockets on startup that are in the listening state. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket#Socket_states_in_the_client-server_model))

- Pub/Sub

> ...a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern))

- WRRC

Web Request Response Cycle. A user might send a request and get a response from a server. WRRC describes that relationship.
