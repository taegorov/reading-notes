# Computer Architecture and Logic - Notes

Computers are **everywhere**

### What Makes a Computer a Computer?

**Computers take input, store info, process that info, then output the results**

A computer is a tool. Tools have historically helped us with manual work, but computers help with the *thinking* work

Computers manipulate information

- Input
  - Via mouse, keyboard, microphone, camera, 

- Storage/Processing
  - Info is stored in memory
  - Runs through an algorithm
  - Stored again

- Output
  - Text, photos, videos, games

### Binary & Data

Computers work with 1's and 0's, but no one has to interact with computers like that anymore

> - 1, True, Yes, On

**vs.** 

> - 0, False, No, Off 

This most basic information is called a *bit*

The number 9 in binary is: 1001

Numbers, text, images, and sound can all be represented by binary. Everything online is ultimately represented by 0's and 1's

### Circuits and Logic

- A simple circuit flips the input you give it (e.g., changes a 1 to a 0)
  - This is called a *not* circuit

Many other circuits that perform simple calculations, combine to create way more complex circuits

### CPU, Memory, Input, Output

CPU does processing (that might sound obvious already)

CPU asks Memory for help to do stuff, based on last time it did a task

Every letter press on a keyboard takes thousands of instructions

> The more info that is input or output, the more processing power and memory a computer needs

### Hardware and Software

Hardware = speakers, chips, etc

Software = apps, games, websites

CPU controls all other parts of the computer

CPU knows which circuit to use and when to use it

Code essentially allows us to talk to a computer in binary via the code
