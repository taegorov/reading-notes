### Notes - Basic usage of canvas

`<canvas>`'s only attributes are height and width. 300px x 150px by default. If these seem distorted, edit height/width in HTML, not CSS.

Remember to add id's to `<canvas>` elements. You should also provide alt's to these!

Styling to `<canvas>` does not affect the information/styling of the drawing itself.
