# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook


- How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

> The second param is an array of variables that the component will check to make sure changed before re-rendering. You could put whatever bits of props and state you want in here to check against. **Or, put nothing... That will ensure the useEffect only runs once.**

- Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

Yes

- Is useState() synchronous?

No


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- State Hook

> ...a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. ([source](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html))

- Component Lifecycle

**Initialization > mounting > updating > unmounting**

Initialization: "This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class."

Mounting: "Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself."

Updating: "Updating is the stage when the state of a component is updated and the application is repainted."

Unmounting: "As the name suggests Unmounting is the final step of the component lifecycle where the component is removed from the page."
