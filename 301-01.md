# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 1

- React is great for constructing user interfaces and is made up of things called "components"

- Components made up of `props` or properties

- the `render` method returns a description, or a React element

- Seems to be much more efficient at displaying HTML than what we learned in 201 with `createElement` and similar code. More intuitive and neater

- "Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children" ([source for quote here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html))

- Arrow function syntax: make sure to remember the `() =>`! It's a common mistake to forget, and leads to errors (or at least unintended results)

- Get code to "remember" things by using *states*

- You can view a React component tree by using a browser's console. Should come in super handy! Just have to install React dev tools

- I thought this following line of code (taken from `this.state.squares`) beautifully summarizes how visually pleasing and intuitive React seems to be:

```
[
  'X', null, 'X',
  'null', 'O', 'O',
  'X', null, null,
]
```
- In the above, we're looking at a Tic Tac Toe board, with various X's and O's already placed, and `null` wherever an X or O has not yet been placed. So awesome!

> In React, itâ€™s conventional to use on[Event] names for props which represent events and handle[Event] for the methods which handle the events.

- **Controlled components** - this seems important but wasn't expanded upon in the article

- `.slice()` is mentioned in the article. We used this in our 201 final project and JB explained it to us.

- By not *mutating data* (or using immutability), we can relatively easily add undo/redo functionality to our games/apps. It keeps "previous versions... intact" ([source for quote here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#complex-features-become-simple))

- **JSX** allows us to write code that looks like this: 
  
```  
const hello = <h1>hello!</h1>
```

- "You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX." ([source for quote here](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx))
