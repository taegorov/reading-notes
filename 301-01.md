# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 1

### React Tutorial through ‘Passing Data Through Props’

- React is great for constructing user interfaces and is made up of things called "components"

- Components made up of `props` or properties

- the `render` method returns a description, or a React element

- Seems to be much more efficient at displaying HTML than what we learned in 201 with `createElement` and similar code. More intuitive and neater

- "Passing props is how information flows in React apps, from parents to children" ([source for quote here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html))

- Arrow function syntax: make sure to remember the `() =>`! It's a common mistake to forget, and leads to errors (or at least unintended results)

- Get code to "remember" things by using *states*
