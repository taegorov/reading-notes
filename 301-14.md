# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 14


## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

> What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?

Personal computers became significantly more popular in people's homes in the US. Families were way more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls, even if interest was the same (or higher!).

> Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

Computer Science professors assumed that their students played on computers growing up, and taught accordingly. This differed from the 70's, when intro courses assumed students had little-to-no knowledge of how to use computers.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

> What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

1. Amazon is extremely white, and Dell and HP are **overwhelmingly** white

2. Nvidia is male dominated (17% female)

3. It seems like younger companies are more likely to be diverse


## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

> When are diversity efforts most successful?

When they're "driven by commitment from company leaders."([source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2015/07/21/why-diversity-matters-your-tech-company/30419871/)) 

> Why do diverse companies perform better?

Because they are smarter and more creative. Successful businesses that lack diversity are akin to a chain smoker living to 100 -- it happened in spite of the smoking.

> Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

They are far more representative of their users and  desired users. It also makes the product/service more relevant to those users/desired users.
