> What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUT creates a new element, PATCH modifies an existing one.

> Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

1. MongoDB
2. Mirage
3. Postman


> Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js

Swagger is open source and can be used on test APIs. APIDoc apears to only be used locally (not via the web).


> Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

Errors on the client's side appear as 400 codes (400, 404, etc.). Server-side errors use 500 codes.


> Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

SOAP = Simple Object Access Protocol ([source](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A97335_02/integrate.102/a90297/overview.htm)). Designed so different languages and platforms could talk to one another. Better suited for enterprise. Requests are returned via XML documents.

REST = Representational State Transfer ([source](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-rest)). It is a "set of architectural principles attuned to the needs of lightweight web services and mobile applications." ([source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/whats-the-difference-between-soap-rest)) Requests are sent through HTTP, and once they're received, information is sent back (in the form of HTML, text, JSON).


> Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Web Server

A web server "stores and delivers the content for a site -- such as text, images, video, and application data -- to clients that request it." ([source](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/web-server/)) Talks to browsers via HTTP.

- Express

"Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications." ([source](https://expressjs.com/))

- Routing

"Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page." ([source](https://divpusher.com/glossary/routing/)) 

- WRRC

Web Request Response Cycle. A user might send a request and get a response from a server. WRRC describes that relationship.
