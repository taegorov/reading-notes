# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 3

Note: As with day 2, I accidentally read all of the [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) page for Read 01. My notes for that particular reading can be found in the day 1 reading [here]([301-01.md).

#### Lifting States Up 

- "Lifting a state up" in React is done by bringing an element up to it's nearest parent/ancestor. That allows two inputs to be in sync. In the reading, `Calculator` contains the 'shared state', so it can influence both `celsius` and `fahrenheit`. It becomes the "source of truth" ([quote taken from reading](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html#lifting-state-up)) 
  - That means `Calculator` can make both `celsius` and `fahrenheit` consistent with each other

- Remember that `props` are **Read-Only**

- `onChange`, `onTemperatureChange`, `onNameChange`, `onTargetChange` - new syntax
  - Usually a prop

A couple examples of these changes, as discussed in the reading:
- `this.state.value` becomes `this.props.value`

- `this.setState()` becomes `this.props.onValueChange()`


>The inputs stay in sync because their values are computed from the same state ([source](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html#lifting-state-up))

- Every piece of data that is able to change should have one **source of truth**

- If more than one component of your code needs to access this state, you lift it up to the parent they have in common (keep hierarchical *top-down flow* in mind)

- Using this method greatly reduces the possibilities of bugs!

#### Lists and Keys

- As we learned in today's code challenge, the `map()` function can loop through an array

- The code to display any array of numbers to a `ul`/`li` element is insanely dry:

```
const exampleNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const showItems = exampleNumbers.map((exampleNumbers) =>
  <li>{exampleNumbers}</li>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{showItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
The above code displays the following (although it omits the highly-suggested **key**. Key's give elements a "[stable identity](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys)"):

```
- 2
- 4
- 6
- 8
- 10
```

- Good practice is to name **keys** after the elements they represent (the reading uses `<li key={}>` as an example). The Article also strongly recommends against using indexes as keys

> A[nother] good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys.

- Keys do not need to be unique globally, just unique to their siblings

#### The Spread Operator

> The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.
>
> ([source](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab))

- A spread operator (or spread syntax) is `...`

Trying to find the largest number in an array like this:

```
Math.max([2,8,55])
```
Would result in "**NaN**". Using a spread operator like this:

```
Math.max(...[2,8,55])
```

Would correctly produce "55"!

- I just have to include this following line of code that the author uses an example, it is just way too cool (and powerful) not to acknowledge ([source](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)):

```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
```

- The spread operator is super helpful with concatenating separate arrays

- I am absolutely blown away by how cool this is!
