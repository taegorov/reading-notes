#  Redux - Asynchronous Actions


- How granular should your reducers be?

It really depends on you or the project/team you're working with. Granularity can be good, but too much of it can be superfluous. 

- Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched

More of a con. The Redux docs say there's no specific rule for this, but if multiple reducers fire when that action is dispatched, it might be worth combining them.

- Name a strategy for preventing the above

"Introducing a new action type that is handled a different way."

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- store

> A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.

> A store is not a class. It's just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

([source](https://redux.js.org/api/store))

- combined reducers

> As your app grows more complex, you'll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state.

> The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

> The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()
