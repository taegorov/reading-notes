# AWS: Events


- Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server

They are similar in that they both respond to HTTP requests designed with REST in mind, and map CRUD methods to PUT/POST/DELETE/GET.

- List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each

1. Aurora, 5x faster than standard MySQL db's at a low cost
2. Relational Database Service, can be easily resized
3. RDS, lets you deploy db's in a VMware environment
4. DynamoDB, key-value based, can handle high traffic
5. ElastiCache, improves web application performance
6. Neptune, quickly query graph db's
7. QLDB, best way to track changes over time
8. Timestream, one of the fastest growing datatypes
9. DocumentDB, supports MongoDB workloads

A general con for all of the above is that your code does not live in one simple-to-access area, for example, if you're working on a team.

- What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

> Standard queues provide at-least-once delivery, which means that each message is delivered at least once. FIFO queues provide exactly-once processing, which means that each message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes it and deletes it. ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/faqs/))

- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?

Send a return message or console.log that confirms it was received.


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:


- Serverless API

> Traditional cloud hosting is permanent. As in, you pick a server provider, and they run your software on multiple servers worldwide. There are precise, recurring physical locations for where your data is stored and functionality processed.

> Serverless computing is a strategic deviation from this model — it is an event-driven setup without permanent infrastructure. This doesn’t mean servers are no longer involved, rather, it means that servers are auto-created on a per-need basis to scale to the demands of your app. ([source](https://nordicapis.com/the-benefits-of-a-serverless-api-backend/))

- Triggers

How you get a Lambda to fire.

- Dynamo vs Mongo

> DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas. ... DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents. ([source](https://www.xplenty.com/blog/dynamodb-vs-mongodb-differences/))

- Dynamoose vs Mongoose

Dynamoose strictly works with AWS's DynamoDB
