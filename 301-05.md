# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 5

- **Single responsibility principle** = components should do one single thing. If they start doing more, break them down into more components

- The reading suggests doing a type of wireframing where you take a mock design of your finished product and break it up into components. Their example looked like the following:

Mock design:

Mock design broken up into components:

The colored boxes around each component represent the following (last part of the bullet is an example component name):

1. Orange - the entire example - `productTable`
2. Blue - accepts user input - `searchBar`
3. Green - the data to be filtered by user input - `productTable`
4. Turquoise - each category's heading - `categoryRow`
5. Red - the actual product - `productRow`

The reading also suggests breaking down/organizing the hierarchy like so:

- `productTable` (orange)
  - `searchBar` (blue)
  - `productTable` (green)
    - `categoryRow` (turquoise)
    - `productRow` (red)


- You can use the above to create the actual UI *sans* interactivity, then implement the interactivity later:

> It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

- Start building from the top-down or the bottom-up. Seems obvious, but I've fallen in the trap of trying to create something from the 'middle' and having my code end up really disorganized

- Cool acronym for DRY code = **Don't Repeat Yourself**

- Useful questions to ask yourself while going through each piece of data:

> 1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>   
> 2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
>
> 3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
