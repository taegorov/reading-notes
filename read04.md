# Chapter 18 Process & Design - Notes

## What kind of page you want to design

### High level process you want to follow to create a new site

- Who is my site for?
- Why would someone want to visit? (what are they trying to achieve?)
- What info does a visitor need?
- How often will they visit?

# Chapter 17 HTML5 Layout - Notes

> Note how these elements are common to the vast majority of web pages

- div element used to be more important (or commonly used) before HTML5
  - articles, footers, asides (and others) no longer need \<div id\> tag
- HTML5 elements provide clearer code than their \<div\> cousins
- Headers and footers sit inside their respective elements
- Sidebars sit inside an \<aside\> element
- Content below header can sit inside a \<section\> element
- Styling occurs with CSS

# Chapter 8 Extra Markup - Notes

- DOCTYPEs depend on what version of HTML you're using. We'll likely only use the following:
> `<!DOCTYPE html>`

- Add comments to your code (these won't appear on your site):
> `<!-- comment here -->` 

- Add ID attributes with:
> `<p id="id name">`

- Add class attributes with:
> `<p class="class name">`

- 

More notes go here, but I didn't finish Chapter 8 on time
