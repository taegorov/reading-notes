# useState() Hook
    

- How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?

React provides a HTML/CSS framework in order to build interfaces with components. With vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, you build all that from scratch yourself. React even provides the training wheels for you to add a favicon. React is much more scalable.

- What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

You have to extend a class component and use `this.`, whereas you set the state in a functional component.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

- Functional Components

Stateless, can be created with a `function abc` syntax or implied with an arrow function. Accept and use props, and don't use `render()`. 

- Children / Child Components

Child components are nested components that inherit props from their parent.
