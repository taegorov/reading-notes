# Reading Notes Code 301: Day 4

- Forms look fairly different from the other elements we've worked with in class so far

- Forms become *controlled components* when combined with React a React state

- Forms made with React take more code, but are more flexible

- In a drop down list that's normally written as `<select>` in HTML, one of the options might start off as `selected`. With React, you'd show this as `this.state = {value: '[selected item]'}` (with [selected item] replaced by whichever of the drop-down menu options you want displayed)

- Add `name` attributes if you have multiple `input` elements
